# Android ML Kit OCR Template

This is a minimal Android app template to demonstrate on-device OCR using Google ML Kit.

## How to run
1. Open in Android Studio.
2. Set `minSdk` and `compileSdk` as required.
3. Gradle sync.
4. Run on a device (camera required for capture) or emulator with Gallery support.

## Notes
- Uses ML Kit Text Recognition (on-device) - no cloud key needed.
- For better camera capture UX, integrate CameraX or a file-based capture flow.
